In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included). Then you have to just print this dictionary d. Example: Input: 4 will give output as {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} Input Format: Take the number n in a single line. Output Format: Print the dictionary d in a single line. Example: Input: 8 Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}\n",

        "#Question 4:There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself. The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Then, the output of the program should be: 2 The numbers after the direction are steps. Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert it into an integer). Input Format: The first line of the input contains a number n which implies the number of directions to be given. The next n lines contain the direction and the step separated by a space. Output Format: Print the distance from the original position to the current position. Example: Input: 4 UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Output: 2\n",
